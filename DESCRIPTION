Description: Contains functions which can be used to compute
    'CLIMDEX' indices <https://www.climdex.org/learn/indices/> using 
    'NetCDF' <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/> input files, 
    writing to NetCDF output files. Code allows for parallel computation 
    of indices using either a SOCK or MPI cluster.
